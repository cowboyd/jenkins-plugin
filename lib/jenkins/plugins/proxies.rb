    # Maps JRuby objects part of the idomatic Ruby API
    # to a plain Java object representation and vice-versa.
    #
    # One of the pillars of Jenkins Ruby plugins is that writing
    # plugins must "feel" like native Ruby, and not merely like
    # scripting Java with Ruby. To this end, jenkins-plugins provides
    # a idiomatic Ruby API that sits on top of the native Jenkins
    # Java API with which plugin developers can interact.
    #
    # This has two consequences. Native Ruby objects authored as part
    # of the plugin must have a foreign (Java) representation with which
    # they can wander about the Jenkins universe and possibly interact
    # with other foreign objects and APIs. Also, Foreign objects
    # coming in from Jenkins at large should be wrapped, where possible
    # to present an idomatic interface..
    #
    # Finally, Native plugin that had been wrapped and are comping home
    # must be unwrapped from their external form.
    #
    # For all cases, we want to maintain referential integrety so that
    # the same object always uses the same external form, etc... so
    # there is one instance of the `Proxies` class per plugin which will
    # reuse mappings where possible.
